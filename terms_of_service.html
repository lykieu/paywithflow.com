              been specifically allowed to do so, by way of a separate agreement with
              FLOW. You specifically agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of

            <h2>VIII. FUNDING: USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT AND FINANCIAL TERMS</h2>
            <p><strong>General Users</strong></p>
            <p>
              1. Users may link up to two United States bank accounts to the Flow. Please
              keep your information current. You may transfer money to your Flow balance
              (Flow Cash) from any bank account linked to your Flow account by requesting
              an electronic transfer from your bank account. You don't need a Flow Cash
              balance to send money or buy something using your Flow account. You may use
              the payment methods linked to your Flow account to fund transactions you
              make using your Flow account.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Money that you receive from other Flow account holders is held as a
              balance in your Flow. Any Flow balance you hold represents an unsecured
              claim against Flows, Inc and is not insured by the Federal Deposit
              Insurance Corporation (FDIC). User balances are held separate from Flow’s
              corporate funds, and Flow will neither use these funds for its operating
              expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these
              funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Business Users</strong></p>
            <p>
              1. <strong>Receiving personal payments: </strong>If you use your Flow
              account to receive payments for the sale of goods and services or accept
              donations, you must not ask your buyer to send you money using the send
              money to family or friends service. If you do so, Flow may remove your Flow
              account’s ability to accept payments from friends or family members.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for
              accepting Flow as a payment method. You may charge a handling fee in
              connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee
              does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you
              charge for non-Flow transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. In representations to your customers or in public communications, you
              agree not to mischaracterize Flow as a payment method. At all of your
              points of sale (in whatever form), you agree not to try to dissuade or
              inhibit your customers from using Flow; and, if you enable your customers
              to pay you with Flow, you agree to treat Flow’s payment mark at least at
              par with other payment methods offered.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar
              governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example,
              value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any
              jurisdiction (collectively, “taxes”). It is your responsibility to
              determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive,
              and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit
              the correct taxes to the appropriate authority. Flow is not responsible for
              determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for
              calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any
              transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Flow may block your ability to receive payments if you sell goods or
              services that may be illegal under any applicable laws or regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
              6. Flow reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions. If Flow
              determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we
              place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of
              the item. Flow will conduct a review and either clear or cancel the
              payment. If the payment is cleared, Flow will provide notice to you to ship
              the item. Otherwise, Flow will cancel the payment and the funds will be
              returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.
            </p>
            <p>
              7. If you accept payments through your Flow
              account in your store location, you must communicate the amount of the
              transaction to the customer before the transaction takes place. You may
              charge your customer’s Flow account only for transactions that they have
              authorized. You must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they
              request one. You agree that any transaction that you make shall have an
              accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.
            </p>
            <p>
              8. If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third party application
              where Flow is offered, obey any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or
              the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make
              through that forum. Any such protections may require you to take certain
              actions and may impact how claims are processed.
            </p>
            <p>
              9. In connection with your use of our websites, your Flow account, the Flow
              services, or in the course of your interactions with Flow, other Flow
              customers, or third parties, you will not:

            <p>
              a. Breach any agreement with Flow or any policy similarly promulgated.
            </p>

              governing financial services, consumer protections, unfair competition,
              anti-discrimination or false advertising).
            </p>
            <p>
              c. Infringe Flow's or any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade
              secret or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or

            <p>
              <strong>Interpretation:</strong>
              The section and subject headings in these Terms are included for reference
              only and shall not be used to interpret any provisions of these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Entire Agreement and Waiver:</strong>
              The Terms, together with the ‘Privacy Policy’ shall constitute the entire
              agreement between you and us concerning the Services. No failure or delay
              by us in exercising any right, power or privilege under the Terms shall
              operate as a waiver of such right or acceptance of any variation of the
              Terms and nor shall any single or partial exercise by either party of any
              right, power or privilege preclude any further exercise of that right or
              the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Severability:</strong>
              If any provision of these Terms is deemed unlawful, invalid, or
              unenforceable by a judicial court for any reason, then that provision shall
              be deemed severed from these Terms, and the remainder of the Terms shall
              continue in full force and effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Partnership or Agency:</strong>
              None of the provisions of these Terms shall be deemed to constitute a
              partnership or agency between you and FLOW and you shall have no authority
              to bind FLOW in any form or manner, whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Governing Law/Waiver:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of District of
              Columbia as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed
              entirely within the District of Columbia between Washington D.C. residents,
              without regard to conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or
              dispute you may have against FLOW must be resolved exclusively only in the
              United States District Court for the District of Columbia (and appellate
              courts from any of the foregoing). You hereby irrevocably and
              unconditionally waive any right to a trial by jury of any dispute arising
              out of or relating to this Agreement. <strong></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>For all Users:</strong>
              YOU MUST COMMENCE ANY LEGAL ACTION AGAINST US WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE
              ALLEGED HARM INITIALLY OCCURS. FAILURE TO COMMENCE THE ACTION WITHIN THAT
              PERIOD SHALL FOREVER BAR ANY CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION REGARDING THE SAME
              FACTS OR OCCURRENCE, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS OR OTHER
              LAW TO THE CONTRARY. WITHIN THIS PERIOD, ANY FAILURE BY US TO ENFORCE OR
              EXERCISE ANY PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OR ANY RELATED RIGHT SHALL NOT
              CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF THAT RIGHT OR PROVISION.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Our legal obligation regarding you: </strong>
              If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including
              garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise
              believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or
              regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions,
              including holding payments to/from your account, placing a reserve or
              limitation on your account, or releasing your funds. We will decide, in our
              sole discretion, which action is required of us. Unless the court order,
              applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires
              otherwise, we will notify you of these actions. We do not have an
              obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving
              you or your account. When we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a
              result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other
              legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place longer
              than 180 days.

              such costs.
